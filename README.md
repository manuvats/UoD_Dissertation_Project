Getting an accurate 3D model of a person's face is essential for remote consultations in fields like dentistry and medicine. Recent advancements in computer vision have yielded impressive results, achieving very high levels of precision. Now, thereâ€™s a rising interest in using deep learning for 3D reconstruction. The aim of this project is to look at the latest deep learning methods for facial 3D reconstruction and figure out their limitations. 
It was initially planned to look at how cropping of the images and background masking affect the quality of the learned representation of the scene. But due to the limited availability of time the project was focused on effects of cropping. 
Different experiments which involved cropping the images in varying proportions and changing the center points of the image and feeding the images into the model to see the effect of cropping on the quality of the 3D reconstruction were performed. The results were then compared and helped to conclude.
